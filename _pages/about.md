Hey there, I'm an undergraduate student in UniveritÃ© du QuÃ©bec Ã  Montral in Computer Science and soft eng. I have gathered here some cool projects I worked on. Check out my [portfolio](https://lancelotnd.github.io/portfolio).
Besides programming, I really enjoy designing visuals, so I've added a [design](https://lancelotnd.github.io/design) section to record some of the things I did over the years.

Thanks for dropping by ! ðŸ˜‰
