## The posters

This time I opted for simple poster with a single emoji. The objective was to combine multiples posters of emojis in order to create meaning. Since poster were hanged after the official announcement of the event, we assumed that students would understand what the poster were referring to. 


Here is an example of the mural

## Emoji tickets

Although the event was free, people needed to register since capcity was limited to 100. Following their registration I programmed a script that would send them an email with their passcode which was a combination of and animal and an adjective.
